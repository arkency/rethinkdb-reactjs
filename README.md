## Where to look for code

* [React component](https://github.com/arkency/rethinkdb-reactjs/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/components/show_article.js.coffee)
* [First render](https://github.com/arkency/rethinkdb-reactjs/blob/master/app/views/articles/show.html.erb#L4)
* [Establish SSE connection and re-render when new data arrived](https://github.com/arkency/rethinkdb-reactjs/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js.coffee#L12)
